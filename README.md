# A/B Testing for Optimizing ML Model Performance  

## Project Overview  
This project aims to compare the performance of **BERT** and **DistilBERT** models for building an efficient **Question and Answering (Q&A) system**. Using an **A/B testing approach**, we evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of both models and determine which one is better suited for Q&A tasks.  

## Key Steps
- Understanding the **SQuAD dataset**  
- Fundamentals of **A/B Testing** and its importance in ML model evaluation  
- Steps and metrics involved in **A/B Testing**  
- Building a **Q&A system** using **BERT** and **DistilBERT**  
- Feature extraction and evaluation techniques for Q&A systems  
- Applying **A/B testing** to determine the better-performing model  
- Analyzing **precision, recall, and accuracy** metrics for model comparison  

## Business Overview  
Testing a machine learning model before replacing an existing one in production is crucial to ensure better performance, robustness, and user experience. A/B testing, also known as **split testing**, is used to compare different machine learning models by randomly assigning users or data points to a **control group** (existing model) and a **treatment group** (new model). The models are then evaluated based on **standardized metrics** such as accuracy and precision to determine statistical significance and overall improvement.  

In this project, we develop a **Q&A system** using **BERT** and **DistilBERT**, both of which are transformer-based language models. We then conduct **A/B testing** to compare their efficiency, model size, and inference speed to optimize model selection for real-world applications.  

## Tech Stack  
- **Language:** Python  
- **Models:** BERT, DistilBERT  
- **Libraries:** Transformers (Hugging Face), Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy  

## About the Models  

### BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers)  
BERT is a **transformer-based** NLP model developed by **Google**, designed to understand the **context of words in a sentence bidirectionally**. It is widely used for **question answering, sentiment analysis, and named entity recognition**. Variants such as **RoBERTa, ALBERT, and ELECTRA** further improve performance on NLP tasks.  

### DistilBERT  
DistilBERT is a **lighter and faster** version of BERT introduced by **Hugging Face**. It retains **97% of BERTâ€™s performance** while using **40% fewer parameters** and being **60% faster**. This is achieved through **knowledge distillation**, making it ideal for **real-time NLP applications**.  

## Project Workflow  
1. **Data Preparation:** Load and preprocess the **SQuAD dataset**  
2. **Model Training:** Train **BERT** and **DistilBERT** for the Q&A task  
3. **A/B Testing Setup:** Randomly assign users/data points to **control and treatment groups**  
4. **Evaluation:** Compare models based on **precision, recall, accuracy, and response time**  
5. **Statistical Significance Testing:** Ensure reliable results  
6. **Model Selection:** Determine the best-performing model for deployment  

## Results & Impact  
By applying **A/B testing**, we ensure that the selected model optimally balances **accuracy, efficiency, and computational cost**, leading to better user experience in **Q&A applications**. This project demonstrates the **importance of model comparison before production deployment** to achieve **cost-effective and high-performance NLP solutions**.
